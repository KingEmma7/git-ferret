"""Rendering findings as markdown.

The output must be readable on a terminal *and* valid markdown in a file, so
this module produces plain text and never emits ANSI escapes or box-drawing
characters. Terminal prettification happens later, in :func:`emit`, and only
when stdout is a TTY.

There are no tables: wide tables do not wrap in a terminal, and this report is
read on screen far more often than in a rendered file.

Spacing is part of the text. A repository's title and the fetch stamp beneath
it are one unit with no blank line between; a blank line separates one
repository from the next.

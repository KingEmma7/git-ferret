"""Remote reachability, reported the same way by every command.

A repository with no configured remote, or whose fetch failed, is unreachable:
the two cases are different evidence for the same finding, so they live in one
place and every command reports them identically. The finding is appended to a
report the caller has already stamped with the run's fetch outcome, which is why
this takes a finished report rather than fetching itself.
